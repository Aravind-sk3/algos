# Solutions to Google FooBar problems

So I got an invitation to be a part of FooBar Challenge, the day I got rejected from Google's Summer of Code.

So, I was naturally pissed at myself. I opened Leetcode and started practicing DSA. While I was searching something about RedBlack Trees. I came across the invitation. Here's how the terminal looks! ‚ù§

PS: I didn't intend to use that Google ID of mine. It is for personal stuff only. üòÇ Can't complain though.

I'll be adding the solutions to each level once I have cleared all 5.
